This directory contains all the material for the workshop on
"Video processing of eye movements with OpenCV" in Lund, Aug 09, 2013.
The workshop is held by
    Thomas Haslwanter (thomas.haslwanter@fh-linz.at), and
    Erich Schneider (eschneider@fh-lausitz.de).

For getting started, open a command window in this directory, and type
"ipython notebook". This will let you work with the introductory
"ipynb"-files included here. Once you have worked through those, you can see
how "PupilFinder.py" implements a working example of an eye movement
analysis.
